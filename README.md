Data Structures and Algorithms in Java *(Second Edition)*

Exercises from the book by Robert Lafore

###Overview

My solutions to *Programming Projects* problem sets at the end of each chapter of the book.

###Approach

The src directory contains a package for each chapter (or will eventually). Each chapter package contains the classes which are addressed in the problem sets.

The spec directory mirrors the chapter structure of the src directory. Each question is translated into a test (or tests) and the src class is modified until the test is green. Where the problem is effectively a refactoring (e.g. converting a linear search to a binary one), the tests will be used to verify that the output has not changed.
